Better namespaces for urls
--------------------------

Historically, the package included multiple urls. To ensure compatibility with django 2
and better namespacing, you should update any references to those urls as described below:

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Old url                             | New url                             |
+=====================================+=====================================+
| dynamic_preferences.global          | dynamic_preferences:global          |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| dynamic_preferences.global.section  | dynamic_preferences:global.section  |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| dynamic_preferences.user            | dynamic_preferences:user            |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| dynamic_preferences.user.section    | dynamic_preferences:user.section    |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+


Migration cleanup
-----------------

This version includes a proper fix for migration issues.
Full background is available at https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/142,
but here is the gist of it:

1. Early versions of dynamic_preferences included the user and global preferences models
   in the same app
2. The community requested a way to disable user preferences. The only way to do that
   was to move the user preference model in a dedicated app (dynamic_preferences_user
3. A migration was written to handle that transparently, but this was not actually possible
   to have something that worked for both existing and new installations
4. Thus, we ended up with issues such as #140 or #141, inconsistent db state, tables
   lying around in the database, etc.

I'd like to apologize to everyone impacted. By trying to make 3. completely transparent to everyone and
avoid a manual migration step for new installations, I actually made things worse.

This release should fix all that: any remains of the user app was removed from the main
app migrations. For any new user, it will be like nothing happened.

For existing installations with user preferences disabled, there is nothing to do,
apart from deleting the `dynamic_preferences_users_userpreferencemodel` table in your database.

For existing installations with user preferences enabled, there is nothing to do. You should have
``'dynamic_preferences.users.apps.UserPreferencesConfig'`` in your installed apps. If ``python manage.py migrate``
fails with ``django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation "dynamic_preferences_users_userpreferencemodel" already exists``,
this probably means you are upgrading for a really old release. In such event, simply skip the initial migration for the
``dynamic_preferences_user`` app by running ``python manage.py migrate dynamic_preferences_users 0001 --fake``.

Many thanks to all people who helped clearing this mess, especially @czlee.

1.5.1 (06-03-2018)
******************

This is a minor bugfix release:

* Get proper PreferenceModelsRegistry when preference is proxy model (#137)
* Add missing `format()` to IntegerSerializer exception text (#138)
* Add some attributes to PerInstancePreferenceAdmin (#135)

Contributors:

* @czlee

1.5 (16-12-2017)
******************

From now on, django-dynamic-preferences should fully support Django 2.0.
This release should be fully backward-compatible with previous versions
of the module.

You will still have to upgrade your own code to work with Django 2, like
adding on_delete option to your ForeignKey fields.

* removed typo in API code that could cause a crash (#127)
* added on_dete=models.CASCADE to migrations for Django 2.0 compatibility (#129 and #131)

******************

Contributors:

******************

* Fix #108: Dropped tests and guaranteed compatibility with django 1.8 and 1.9, though
* Fix #103: bugged filtering of user preferences via REST API
* Fix #78: removed ``create_default_per_instance_preferences``.
  This is *not* considered a backward-incompatible change as this method did nothing at all
  and was not documented

1.3 (03-07-2017)
*******************

This release fix a critical bug in 1.2 that can result in data loss.

Please upgrade to 1.3 as soon as possible and never use 1.2 in production. See `#81 <https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/81>`_ for more details.

1.2 (06-07-2017)
*******************

.. warning::

    There is a critical bug in this that can result in dataloss. Please upgrade to 1.3 as
    soon as possible and never use 1.2 in production. See `#81 <https://github.com/EliotBerriot/django-dynamic-preferences/pull/81>`_ for more details.

- important performance improvements (less database and cache queries)
- A brand new `REST API <https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rest_api.html>`_ based on Django REST Framework, to interact with preferences (this is an optionnal, opt-in feature)
- A new `FilePreference <https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.io/en/latest/preference_types.html#dynamic_preferences.types.FilePreference>`_ [original work by @macolo]

1.1.1 (11-05-2017)
*******************

Bugfix release to restore disabled user preferences admin (#77).

1.1 (06-03-2017)
*****************

* Fixed #49 and #71 by passing full section objects in templates (and not just the section identifiers). This means it's easier to write template that use sections, for example if you want have i18n in your project and want to display the translated section's name. URL reversing for sections is also more reliable in templates. If you subclassed `PreferenceRegistry`  to implement your own preference class and use the built-in templates, you need to add a ``section_url_namespace`` attribute to your registry class to benefit from the new URL reversing.

[Major release] 1.0 (21-02-2017)
***********************************

Dynamic-preferences was release more than two years ago, and since then, more than 20 feature and bugfixe releases have been published.
But even after two years the project was still advertised as in Alpha-state on PyPi, and  the tags used for the releases, were implicitly saying that the project was not production-ready.

Today, we're changing that by releasing the first major version of dynamic-preferences, the ``1.0`` release. We will stick to semantic versioning and keep backward compatibility until the next major version.

Dynamic-preferences is already used in various production applications .The implemented features are stable, working, and address many of the uses cases the project was designed for:

- painless and efficient global configuration for your project
- painless and efficient per-user (or any other model) settings
- ease-of-use, both for end-user (via the admin interface) and developpers (settings are easy to create and to manage)
- more than decent performance, thanks to caching

By making a major release, we want to show that the project is trustworthy and, in the end, to attract new users and develop the community around it. Development will goes on as before, with an increased focus on stability and backward compatibility.

**Because of the major version switch, some dirt was removed from the code, and manual intervention is required for the upgrade. Please have a for the detailed instructions:** https://django-dynamic-preferences.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade.html

Thanks to all the people who contributed over the years by reporting bugs, asking for new features, working on the documentation or on implementing solutions!
